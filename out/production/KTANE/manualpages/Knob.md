# The Knob
### Things to note:
- You only care about the first 6 in the sequence (unless it's alternating).

### Giveaways
- First three are 000 - LEFT
- First three are 011 - DOWN
- First three are 001 - UP
- First three are 101 and NOT alternating 101010 for the first 6 - RIGHT

### If alternating 101010, look at the bottom row
- 011011 - Up
- 010001 - Down
